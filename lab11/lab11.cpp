Computer randomly generates two positive integers with a difference of at least 11.
Computer randomly selects an integer 'x' between the two integers.
Computer gives user a starting score of 10 points.
Computer asks user to guess a number between the two randomly generated integers.
If user guess is less than x then the computer will prompt user to guess higher and subtract one point from total score.
If user guess is higher than x then the computer will prompt user to guess lower and subtract one point from total score.
If the user guesses correctly then the computer will let the user know they won and output their score.
If total score reaches 0 then the computer will let the user know they lost and ask if they would like to play again.
If user accepts request the computer returns to step one.
If user declines request the computer ends the program.
